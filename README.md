# Fortune-cookies
This a __*Single Page Application*__ which allows users to __*read, share and save*__ to favorites some *__interesting fortune cookies.__*
Originally this was an exam assignment for *__JavaScript Applications course at Telerik Academy__*.
I have *__modified the original application__* skeleton and implemented a slightly different solution using the following technologies:

* MongoDB
* Express
* AngularJS
* Node
